# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Do not share the database as PostgreSQL uses system id as the login user name.
# Need to check the database.yml.sample as the production deployment.
/config/database.yml

# Do not git the .DS_Store file from Mac OS.
